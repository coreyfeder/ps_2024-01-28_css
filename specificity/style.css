/* 
What about conflicts?
There is a whole system of prioritizing: SPECIFICITY.
See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity
(remember the CN-22 form you built.)
But in equal cases, they'll be evaluated sequentially; later assignments 
will overwrite earlier assignments.
I wonder if the declaration order changes the effects? (i.e., is it always
the order the declarations appear in the stylesheet, or does the order 
properties are assigned to the element matter?
